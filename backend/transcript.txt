hello guys so one of the most requestedvideo uh by many of you was to start aseries on developing multi agents usinglangra so finally I've started thisparticular Series in this video we aregoing to discuss about what is Langgraph why do you require langra alongwith this we'll also be getting startedwith one practical example how toprobably go ahead and create your multiagents so if you're new to this Channelplease make sure that you subscribe thechannel and watch this video till theend because this entire video will befor 40 minutes you know somewhere around35 to 40 minutes where I will beexplaining each and everything so thatyou can also get started with Langlangra not only this uh I have plannedlot of videos in this series so thatwhere you where we discuss lot of endto-end projects how to could probablycreate chat Bots how you can use it indifferent different domains likecustomer support you know um let's sayif you want to book your tickets if youwant to probably do multiple task itselfso all those things will be included inthis particular series one moreadditional thing guys uh I've been uhbringing up some amazing courses in Udiso if you are interested to take up allthose kind of courses it is anaffordable courses just in 399 rupeesyou can probably check out in the linkin the description of this particularvideo so yes let's go ahead and enjoythis particular series thank you helloguys in this video and in the upcomingseries of video we are going to discussabout a new module in Lang chin which iscalled as Lang graph now Lang graph iscalled quite amazing because it actuallyhelps you to build stateful multiactorapplication with llms it is used tocreate agent and multi-agent workflow sothis is really important now there arelot of libraries a lot of Open Sourcelibraries that are available whichactually helps you to create multi-agentworkflow but if I probably consider Langgraph it's quite amazing uh so in thisentire video and in the upcoming seriesof video I will be discussing manythings about Lang graph first of all theagenda of this particular video will bethat we'll try to discuss what exactlyis Lang graph why Lang graph and uhwe'll see or we'll try to create achatbot wherein we will get just startedwith langra where I will be showing youwith respect to all the coding thingsright so all these things we will becovering and when we'll discuss aboutwhy Lang graph at that point of timeyou'll understand the importance of Langgraph and uh through this you knowyou'll also be able to cover or you'llbe able to just compare with all thelibraries open source libraries that areavailable to create multi- aai agentsworkflows right and I feel right nowlangra is quite amazing and as you allknow Lang uh what Lang chain is alsodoing is that Lang chain is coming upwith this own cloud platform throughwhich you will be able to build your ownuh agent multi-agent workflow uh usinglangra and it you can do it completelyin a visualization way right and rightnow it it just supports for the Macmachine so so uh we'll be discussing allabout that as we go ahead but right nowlet's go ahead and focus on first of allwe'll go ahead and see the definition ofLang graph so if I talk about what islangra langra is a library for buildingstateful multi-actor application withllms used to create agent and multi-agent workflows compared to other llmFrameworks it offers the core benefitCycles so this is really importantcontrollability and persistence okayLang graphs allows you to Define theflows that involves cycle essential formost agentic architecturedifferentiating it from dag basedSolutions now if you have seen alreadymy previous video I hope everybody knowsabout graph DB okay so what exactly isgraph DB it probably helps you to createyou know if I probably just talk aboutcreating rag application using graphknowledge right so here specifically youhave nodes you have relationship betweenthe nodes uh like this you know and uhwith the help of this kind ofrelationships you can actually buildthis graph knowledge okay and graphknowledge is specifically built rightnow even in Google search engine you'llbe able to see graph knowledge and withthe help of this graph knowledge you'llbe able to develop some amazing ragapplication because the efficiency uhwith respect to the graph knowledgesearch is quite amazing you know sograph knowledge has the combination ofall the kind of search the hybrid searchthe graph knowledge search you know sowhenever you have any information whichis uh displayed or which is probablyconverted into a graph knowledge uhinformation then your conversation withthis kind of data store right can bequite amazing so already I havediscussed about this in our previousvideo but in this video we will try totalk about Lang graph and the main thingwill be that how we have actuallycreated this graph DB structure right inthe form of graph knowledge similarlyLang graph is also offers those kind offunctionality we can create the entiremulti- aai agent workflow using thisgraph knowledge itself right so like howwe have nodes relationship and allsimilarly in the Lang graph also we'llbe able to do that okay so uh till nowwe have just discussed about thedefinition don't worry if you're notable to understand because once we startthe practical application everythingyou'll be able to understand okay nowlet's talk about the second question thesecond most important question y langragraph y Lang graph okay now here I willbe talking about some amazing benefitsof using Lang graph in pointwise okay solet's go and talk about this amazingbenefits of using Lang graph so numberone okay number one is that it reallysimplifies thedevelopment simplifiesdevelopment now when I say simplifiesdevelopment what does this basicallymean see whatever complexities usuallywhenever we develop any multi- AI agentsright there are multiple things that isinvolved the StateManagement State Management StateManagement of the agent like at whichstage at what work it needs to really doand agent coordination let's say oneagent needs to communicate with anyother agents right when we say agents weare basically talking about multi- AIagents right so this two things are veryimportant you know here if I probablyseen most of the libraries that I'veactually used most of the open sourcelibraries that I've used to probablydevelop multi- a agents this twoinformation that we have that is StateManagement and agent coordination Ifound out a lot of difficulties withrespect to managing this things rightbut with the help of Lang graph itreally simplifies it now when we talkabout State Management and a agentcoordination what does this basicallymean let's say that I'm using three tofour multi- aai agents in my generativeAI application One agent is probablydoing some Wikipedia search so let's sayI probably need I require agent one Irequire agent two I require agent threeright so let's say all these specificagents are there right each and everyagent probably needs to it does somespecific task right let's say this willbe doing a Googlesearch this will be doing a Wikipediasearch and this will probably do avector search Vector DBsearch right and here is my chatbotwhich is specifically using all thismulti- aagents now whenever we develop this kindofapplication it is very important that wehave to do the state managementefficiently for all theagents and also the agentcoordination what does agentcoordination basically means thecommunicationbetween the communication between thiskind of Agents let's say whenever aquery is asked first of all we go Ahadand ask agent one hey whether you reallyneed to do the Google search if youdoing it you really need to provide thatinformation to agent two then agentthree will probably come into picture sothis kind of communication is basicallya kind of agent coordination okay sowhenever we are developing this kind ofthings you know and there may be alsoscenario that when you're developing ause case the agent one response may bedependent on agent two uh response youknow so agent two will only be able towork when they get the response fromagent one I'm just giving somehypothetical scenarios okay now when weare developing this kind of chat Bots uhas a developer we we really need toDefineworkflows we need to Defineworkflows we need to DefineLogics right without worrying rightwithout worrying about so many differentthings right so that is what it actuallydoes langra actually provides you thisentire simply it simplifies this entiredevelopment process and it will actuallyhelp you to create an efficient multi-aai agents right so we'll be discussingmore about it then we go ahead anddiscuss about the Practicalimplementation second thing is that uhwhy Lang graph you should use it secondthing a very important point is relatedto flexibility okay so whenever we talkabout flexibility I will just uh makesure to provide some descriptioninformation over here so that you'll beable to refer thisokay so with respect to flexibility youcan see with langra develop developershave the flexibility to Define their ownagent logic communication protocols thisallows for highly customized applicationtailored to specific use cases whetheryou need a chatboard that can handlevarious types of user request or amulti-agent system that performs complextask langra provides the tools to buildexactly what you need okay so it's allabout giving you the power to create souh with respect to flexibility as I saidthe kind of Logics that you canbasically write will be quite amazingyou'll be seeing that how Grand Manlevel Logics you can actually write withrespect to each and every agents thatyou specifically create I'll be showingyou as we go ahead with one very goodpractical example okay then the thirdthing is that if I talk about the thirdimportant Point why specifically weshould use Lang graph uh it is relatedtoscalability okay now whenever we talkabout scalability here when we arebuilding this multi-agent application wecan actually build large scalemulti-agent application largescalemulti- agentapplications now what what do we mean bylarge scale multi-agentapplication see the kind of robustarchitecture we basically use this largescale multi- agent we basically say thisas lar scale multi- agent applicationbecause it can it canhandle it can handle high volume ofinteraction high volume of interactionright the interaction can be betweenagents and it also has a really amazingor complexworkflows and you'll be seeing when weDefine about complex workflows it it itwill be very simple to develop thisentire workflow itself right and evenLang chain is coming up with a featureand probably many people many companiesare going to use specifically inEnterprise right and there is also anEnterprise version we can specificallydevelop this as an Enterprise levelapplication right with all the featuresand it is also coming up with its owncloud where you can just do drag anddrop and you can actually create thisright uh final uh important feature uhif I talk about is something called asfaulttolerance fault tolerance so it also hasthis amazing feature Lang graphokay so the kind of libraries you'll beseeing Lang graph libraries will includeright uh it will be able to handleerrors you'll be seeing that it'll beable to handleerrors uh it'll beensuring uh even though your applicationfails it should be continuously workingand um let's say that one individualagent encounters an error right thenalso there will be some fault tolerancemechanic M it will basically havewherein it will not just stop theapplication but instead it will keep onrunning right so this is one of the veryimportant core core feature that isreliability right whenever we talk aboutreliability so uh this was two importantthings we have discussed about thedefinition of Lang graph we havediscussed why Lang graph now it's timethat I show you some of the amazing uhapplications how we can actually goahead with the development here uh whatwe are basically going to do is that weare going to create a chatbot okay anduh we'll try to create an agent uh let'ssay in the form of chatbot and again inthe back back side right or in the backend you'll be able to see that we'llalso be able to create a graph like howthat entire agent specifically works soquickly I will go ahead and this I'mexecuting in the Google collab you canalso go ahead and use it okay so let'ssay that I will just use any of the GPUthat I have okay I'll just go ahead andconnect itanyhow you don't require GPU in this uhbut uh definitely we will be seeing thatif you have any kind of uh if you if yourequire any kind of keys over here andwhen I say that I'm going to create achatbot let me just go ahead and discussabout this architecture of the chatbotso what I'm going to create over hereright so let's say that uh there's achatbot over here this chatbot I willtry to create some kind of node let'ssay this will be my start node okaywhenever any user query comes you shouldbe able tosee that I will create a chatbot overhere this chatbot can basically interactwith any llm models okay and once itprobably gives you theoutput we should end this entire flowokay so the reason why I'm drawing thisin the form of graph because Lang graphalso does the same thing okay so Langgraph also creates the entire flow inthe form of graph itself where you'llhave nodes and all right now there aretwo main important things when we seethis these are specifically nodes rightstart and end node this chatbot is onenode and when I write chatbot thatbasically means it is having some kindof definition right if a chatbot needsto move from one step let's say from onestate to the other state we basicallycall that as a state managementmement right so probably after executingthis the chart bot is moving towards theend state so something is basicallyhappening so let's go ahead and createthis and then you'll be able tounderstand more about it okay so firstof all we will go ahead and install pipinstall Lang graph so we are going tospecifically use Lang graph Lang graphokay and we will also use Lang Smith solet's go ahead and execute this lsmith Ihope everybody knows what exactly is sotill then I will also go ahead and showyou the documentation page of Lang graphso this is what langra is all aboutright it has python it has it supportsJavaScript and all but uh uh if I justgo ahead and show you Lang graphtutorials right so here you can see thisis the tutorial right and uh not thissorry uh let's see yes yes here you goright in the Lang graph page it shouldbe somewhere or let me just go to Langchain Lang chain.comand uh here here is your Lang graph yesso here you can actually see we will tryto create this kind of nodes right anduh I hope everybody has seen this kindofnodes specifically right so what doeslangra actually supports you to itprovides controllable cognitivearchitecture for any task it is designedfor human agent collaborations all rightthis kind of graphs also you'll be ableto see all these things I will try toshow you in this video so it has thisfault tolerant scalability optimized forreal world interaction and integrateddeveloper experience amazing featuresand I feel right if you probably uh getthe access of the beta server right andyou'll just be able to see the power ofthis but at the end of the day we willbe creating some amazing agents you knowso here you can see I have installedboth the libraries langra and lsmith nowlet's go ahead and start more thingsover here now as we go ahead we are alsogoing toinstall Lang chain because we definitelyrequire Lang chain and then we are goingto use Lang chenore Gro along with thiswe are also going to uselinore Community right so these alllibraries will be specifically requiredin order to build our entire chatbotright so here you can see theinstallation is basically taking placeokayperfect now let's go ahead and import Osor what I will do is that I will writefrom google. collab okay import userdataokay uh nowsee as you all know when we workedspecifically with vs code you know weused to create environment variables toex ACC any Keys it can be grock API itcan be lsmith Keys now similarly withrespect to Google collab whenever youare working with Google collab here youcan see one option here you can actuallygo ahead and upload all your secret Keyslet's say if you want to use grock APIif you want to use open API if you wantto use lsmith API if you want to usehugging face API you can just go aheadand enter it over here add a new secretcan you can add the key and value pairokay here is your password here is yourkey namenow in order to access this key you canactually see that I've already uploadedit over hereright so let's say since I'm going touse a chatbot which will be interactingwith my Gro API so if you don't knowabout grock API you can just go overhere and search for gro.com uh when yougo to gro.com you can sign it with youremail ID let's say I'm going to sign itbecause it provides you free API toaccess the open source models you knowso I will go to grock API over here andhere you you will be able to see thatlot of different different models arebasically available right Lama 3.1 youalso have llama 3 you have gamma 29b youhave distal whisper large V3 encoding uhso all these kind of models are thereyou can specifically use this particularmodel I've already covered this in myprevious videos okay now in thisscenario what I'm actually going to do Iwill be using some apis for this so if Igo and click on start building here youcan see that I will go to my grock Cloudconsole then here you can go to API Keysonce you go to API Keys you can probablycreate your own API key I've created somany different API Keys uh you can goahead and create your own API key rightI've already shown that also in myprevious videos once you create an APIkey just go ahead and click over hereadd a new secret key just go ahead andwrite groor API key and put it over hereright all the API Keys itself now onceyou're able to add in the secret thenext thing is that I will try to readthat particular API key in my Googlecollab so in order to read I will goahead and write from google. collab UTuser data and uh let's say that I wantmy grock uncore API uncore key I canjust use this userdata do get grock API key so if I goahead and just print this you'll be ableto see that I'm actually able to read ityou know groc API key this is just to toshow you don't use this anyhow uh sohere you can see it is Grant it isasking should we access this particularsecret name Gro API key The Notebooktitleduntitled6 Point IP does not have accessto secret name Grant access so if Iclick on Grant access but right now whathappened timeout happened right so I'llgo ahead and execute it once again andnow you'll be able to access this rightso this is my grock API key that you areable to seeperfect right so now this grock API keyI can actually use it I can use it foruh creating my L application anythingthat I want okay now once this is doneuh what I'm actually going to do I'malso going to use lsmith okay and I hopeeverybody knows what exactly is lsmithright so here I will go ahead and writelsmith uh Langs Smith actually helps youto so if I go ahead and just do sign upright it'll be able to help you to trackeach and every information with respectto the interaction that you have createdin your chat B right so if you go tolsmith over here here also you'll beable to get the dashboard rightso I'll go to settings here is my APIkey if you don't have an API key goahead and create an API key but if yougo ahead and see in my secret key I'vealready added that Langs smithore API _keyokay now let's go ahead and read thelsmith key also so I will go ahead andwrite Lang Smith is equal to userdata. getet and here also I'm going touse BLSmith blank Smith let's see what is thekeynameokay okay so I will just go ahead andprint my L Smithokay so here you'll be able to see thatI will also be able to get it so it willask for Grant access I will give thegrant access over here and it should beable to display it and it is displayingAF is the last term AF is also over hereso I have read both this particular keyand both this key will be specificallyused for creating my chatbot applicationlsmith will be specifically used fortracking everything that is basicallyhappening over here now the next thingyou do that I will go ahead and importOS then let's go ahead and import os.enviren I will just go ahead and keepsave all these things right so first ofall I need Lang chain uh sorry lsmithAPI key okay I can also go ahead andwrite lsmith or I can also go ahead andwrite langin API key so let's go aheadand do this Lang chain API key I willset this to my lsmith okay we need toset up this specific Keys itself okay umthen my endpoint endpoint isspecifically not required I will just goahead and copy this two things and thisis basically just used to set up thebasic requirements right lch and tracingV2 and langin project okay so let's saythis will basically be my course Langgraph okay so this is what is my projectname that I'm actually writing I'msaying that hey you need to make surethat you need to keep the tracing _ V2as true and L langin API key is nothingbut it is assigned to lsmith API key nowyou may be thinking Chris why did youuse l lore API key no you can also uselsmith but according to yourdocumentation when I saw both of themwere satisfied so I just used linore APIkey so let's go ahead and execute thisso once this is executed you'll be ableto see all the information over here nowquickly let's go ahead and write fromlinore grock import Chad Gro because Ineed to use the Chad gr open sourcemodels okay now this is done now I willgo and create my llm model so which isnothing but chat grock and inside this Iwill be using my groor API uncope keywhich is equal to grock APIkey and my model underscore name will benothing but you can use multiple modelsany models that you want so in the groCloud I can see there is Lama 3.1anything that you want I will just goahead and use this gamma 29b it okay sothis specific model I will go ahead anduse it it is up to to you now nothingcompulsory which model you really needto use you can use any model that isprovided by Gro right so this is donethis is my llm modelokay now the next step will be that nowhere you can see yeah I'm able to accessall the models I'm able to access themodel gamma 29b it okay now it's time westartbuildingchatbot usingLang graph right so here is what we aregoing to basically start and this is themost important thing right so if Iprobably go ahead and say this okay sofirst of all uh understand there aremultiple things which we really need tostart with the importing part okay sofirst of all I will be importingsomething called as annotated right sofrom typing I will be importingannotated from typing extension I'll beimporting type dict okay uh along withthisI will be importing two importantlibraries from Lang graph so I will goahead and write from Langgraph uh you'll understand why thisimporting is done just in some time okayfrom Langgraph. graph okay I'm going to just goahead and import two things one is Stategraph State graph actually helps you tomanage the entire State Management thenyour start node start node and your endnode right your you remember that Iactually created a uh a diagram rightwhere we had a startat node then we hadan end node which actually uh shows theflow of the entire chart bot itself okayalong with this uh I will also beshowing let this see the state graph isbasically used for the State Managementpurpose now the state graph needs tokeep on changing based on someparameters okay so for that what I willbe doing I will go ahead and write fromLanggraph langra dograph.messages message I'm just going to goahead and importaddore messages okay now this is one ofthe function what it does is that wehave this something called as messagesright as we keep on adding the messagesover here we will be able to see thatour state management our state of theagent will keep on changing now thismessages is just like you can understandlike when a user is giving a query thellm model is giving a response when itis giving a response the message willget added over here and then my state ofthe chat bot will also get changed rightso this messages is basically keepingthe track of all those things okay sonow let's go ahead and execute this sothis has got executed successfully youcan understand each and everything I'vehave actually explained we will talkabout this too right just in some timenow now we will go ahead and create ourown class let's say this is my classstate which will be um making sure to uhprobably control the entire StateManagement here I will go ahead andwrite typed dict okay so I will go aheadand write typed dict typed dictokay typed dict okay so this class isbasically inheriting this particulartype D uh okay now what we will do wewill go ahead and write some commentsover here okay so that you'll be able tounderstand messages that have the typelist the add message function in Theannotation defines how this state keyshould be updated it appends the messageto the list rather than overwriting soinside this class I've created avariable called as messages okay andthis messages is of type annotated andthis annotated is basically saying heyit is a list typeand here I'm using this function calledadd messages this add messages will beresponsible on adding or appending themessages to this list okay which isbasically created in the form of list inthis messages variable and it will notoverride them the entire StateManagement will be controlled as we keepon adding this particular messagesbecause on every ad we will be changingour state okay now the next thing thatwe will go ahead andDefine since I've defined my class StateI will go ahead and write my graphBuilder okay I will go ahead and DefineMy Graph Builder so this is what westart our graph building process so hereI'm going to use State graph the stategraph which I have actually imported itover here and this state graph will havethis particular class which is called asstate because this state knows whichmessages are there what messages arebasically getting appended and thisgraph Builder should be responsible inmanaging the enti State Management rightso once I execute this here is my graphBuilder so let me just go ahead andexecute this so This Is My Graph Builderover here right so here you can see Langgraph. graph. state state graph at thisspecific location so guys now after wehave created the graph Builder uh whatwe are basically going to do is that uhalready in this diagram you saw thatright we are going to create thischatbot now this chatbot should beinteracting with our llm so for this wewill go ahead and write some definitionso let's quickly go aheadand uh create a function definitionchatbot and remember whenever wecreating any node right in this entiregraphBuilder it needs to take the parameteras state okay whatever state we aregiving over here and this will beimportant because the reason is verysimple because based on this statemessage right whatever messages whateverinteraction that we are doing the statemanagement will keep on changing so herewe go ahead and Define this chatbotwhere we take the parameter as state andthen we return you know that after anyresponse that we get from the chat botwe need to update this messages variableso here I will go ahead and create thismessages and here I will just go aheadand write llm do invoke okay and thisinvoke will be specifically invokingfrom the state message which will havethe user queries right so whenever auser query you'll be able to see thatthis messages will get appended in thisparticular message variable and once itdoes that we just going to invoke thatand whatever response we getting it weagain appending it over here right or weare putting in this particular value weare returning this entire in thisparticular format when we return thiswhen we are inheriting the state classright it is going to understand Heywhenever we return this kind of messageit is going to trigger this add messageand it is going to add this in thismessages variable okay so justunderstand in this way is that here Ihave a chatbot function which isinvoking the previous messages basedgiven by the user and we are returningsome kind of messages over here okay soonce we execute this I will be gettingmy chatbot now this chatbot needs to getadded in this graph Builder so here Iwill go ahead and write graphcoreBuilder dot addore node and here I'mgoing to specifically use chatbot as mynode name name which will have thefunctionality of this particular chatbotokay so once I execute this you'll beable to see that this entire node isbasically getting added so now if I goahead and just display this you'll notbe able to see much things over here butwe will be seeing the entirediagram so step by step you can see thatwhat we have done first of all we havecreated this class State then we havecreated our graph builder then we havedefined our chatbot what functionalityis basically doing and what is returningit is returning just message colon somesome output that we are getting overhere right and remember this chart botis inheriting the state class and thestate class has one variable messages inthe form of list and there is a functioncalled as addore message which will keepon appending whatever message we arespecifically getting over here right sothat is what it is basically doing nowsince we have created this graph Buildernow it's time that we connect thischatbot to the start and the end nodeokay so here I'm going to go ahead andwrite graph Builder dot add edge okay soadd edge start chatbot okay so we arebasically going to add the start and thechatbot and similarly we are going toadd chatbot till the end right so thenonly we will be able to find out uhwe'll be able to get this kind of flowso start is basically appended withchatbot and chatbot is basically gettingappended with end start basically meansonce ever we get get a user query itwill just start the process then chatbotwill do the interaction with llm it'llgive us the value and it will go to theend State and how this state managing isbasically happening because of thisstate class which we have inher in graphBuilder Okay so once we execute thisthis is done so finally what we do aftercreating this after adding all thesenodes we go ahead and write graphBuilder we need to compile it so we'llgo ahead and write do compile so once wecompile it we'll be getting our entiregraph ready so here is my graph itselfso once I execute this my graph is readynow let me just go ahead and displaythis so in order to display this uh inthe documentation I saw this code wherethey are importing dis uh image anddisplay and there is something called asgraph. get graph so here instead ofgraph I'll write graph Builder okay orsorry it should be graph only because wehave compiled it get graph draw mermaidPNG okay okay so once I execute thisyou'll be able to see that I'll begetting this entire flow so start andend are just like one private uhfunctions that are present inside the uhState uh State uh I probably say thisparticular class the state graph classright uh which is present inside thislang. graph Lang Lang graph. gra rightand now this will basically as soon asthe user queries we will go to the startState then it goes to the chat chatbothere the interaction will basicallyhappen and once the interaction happensthe state should change right once weget the response it will go to the endState now let's go ahead and executethis and then only you'll be able to seethe output okay uh and we are just goingto start this okay so here I will justgo ahead and write whiletrue user uncore input is equal toinput userinput user and here I'm going to just goahead and write if user uncoreinput dolowerin let's say I will go ahead and say heyif you just going and typing in quit orQ right we just going to stop theconversation with the flow right so hereI'm just going to writeprint goodbyeokay and then we just going to breakfrom here okay but if the user inputsomething else so here I will goad andwrite for event in graph. stream okay wejust going to stream and here we aregoing to use this messages as my keyvariable messages is a colon and hereI'm going to give based on user seeinitially whenever user gives the inputmessage I need to set this as user rightas a parameter and here will basicallybe my user inputokay then I will go ahead and writeprint event.values we are just going to print thevalues then here more we can go aheadand probably convert this or explorethis values so here I will write forValue in event do values print value andinside that value there will be a keywhich is called as message messages okayand then we will go ahead and print ourassistantmessage assistant basically means themessage that is basically coming fromour uh llms so here you'll be able toseevaluemessages docontent so here let's explore this codefirst of all a user is giving an inputif it is not giving quit and Q so itwill go to graph. stream with respect toall the messages that users have alreadygiven then we are going to get thatevent. values for Value we are going toget two important things one is value ofmessages and one is uh the value ofmessages of content so this value ofmessages I think it should have the usermessage and this should have the llmmodel respon uh response so let me goahead and executeit so I will go ahead and write hellolet's see so here assistant you can seeright hello how can I help you see allthese messages are basically coming inthe form of Dick value right so here uhhello how can I help you today is theresponse and I'm able to get so let mego ahead and ask what is JAI right so here you'll be able to seethat all the response is there rightgeni is a type of artificialintelligence think of it so it's amazingright you're able to get the entireresponse and here also you can seeresponse metadata content is over hereso if you just go ahead and explore thissome of the other keys will be availableover hereright anduh uh if you go ahead and see down sothis is my entire generative message soif I just go ahead and write Q it shouldbe exiting over here right so here youcan see it says goodbye so guys I hopeyou like this specific video uh and youwere able to understand how to basicallycreate a simple chatbot in the form ofLang with the help of Lang graph andhere we have basically used the graphitself right from start till the endnodewe have understood that whenever wecreate any node it also needs to have adefinition and uh how we can connecteach and every node now in the upcomingvideos we are going to develop morecomplex projects on Lang graph wherewe'll be using external tools uh therewill just not use one node but therewill be multiple nodes as we go ahead soI hope you like this particular video Iwill see you all in the next video thankyou
