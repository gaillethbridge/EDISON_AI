          is_correct: true,
          explanation: "This is correct. Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled examples to make predictions, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data."

          text: "Supervised learning is faster than unsupervised learning",

          text: "Supervised learning requires no human intervention",
